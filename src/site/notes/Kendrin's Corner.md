## Planting a Digital Garden

Once upon a time, the web was a wild place. There were geocities and angelfires. And animated gifs. Oh, my god, the animated gifs! What nineties kid needed the flower power of their parents or grandparents when they had *those* to play with? (It was a dangerous time to be epileptic, trust me.)

Eventually, just like the rest of us, the web grew up. *Platforms* became a thing. MySpace gave way to Facebook, Blogger gave way to Tumblr, and all of it gave way to YouTube and now to TikTok. Who knows what's next?

As the digital landscape became more fragmented, we—despite being more connected than ever before—became more disconnected than ever. Authenticity became a buzzword rather than an experience. The Almighty Algorithm (whatever the hell that really is) became King.

Okay. That *might* be a poetic exaggeration. Still, I do think *something* was lost along the way.

But recent years have seen a resurgence of what the (so-called) kids these days are calling ‘the Indie Web’[^1], and a reincarnation—perhaps *evolution* is a better word—of those digital homesteads of yore: the digital garden[^2].

**This one is mine.**

### What's Here

Nothing yet. Give me time.



[^1]: See https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IndieWeb for a brief explanation. The movement itself has actually been around for a couple of decades, though, personally, I think it gained particular popularity during COVID, when we all suddenly had a surplus of free time and nothing but the internet to entertain us. But don’t quote me on that.

[^2]: See https://maggieappleton.com/garden-history for a decent overview of the history of digital gardening. Not, mind, that all (or even most) indie websites are digital gardens. Personally, I think, digital gardens are a unique outgrowth of contemporary personal note-taking and journalling practices that happens to fit well into the Indie Web ecosystem. But, again, that's just my opinion. YMMV.
